In this folder you can find some concrete examples of applications generated using the it.polimi.mobilecodegenerator project. 
For each application you can find two subfolders:

- generated: contains the source code as it is generated by the it.polimi.mobilecodegenerator in src-gen folder based on the application model stored in the .xmi file taken as input of the code generation process. All used .xmi files are stored in the src/model folder of it.polimi.mobilecodegenerator project.

- completed: contains the complete source code, result of manual changes (in Eclipse or Xcode) inside generated source code for the completion of missing features required for the desired application.
